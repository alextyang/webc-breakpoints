        <p> Ideally, Police officers protect public safety and individual liberty by enforcing the law. As a part of a community and the government, they should build a positive relationship through respecting rights and public good. Police respond to potential criminal activity and attempt to halt and punish offenders.</p>

        <p>However, when police are thought of as the primary solution for 'law and order', police department funding becomes a popular way for politicians to address feelings of unsafety. With American police departments using up the majority of funds in their areas, a lot of money has been spent on the militarization of these government agents.</p>
        <p>These heavily armed PDs often escalate situations and abuse their power to harass and kill people of color & queer people, while approximately 38% of murders, 66% of rapes, 70% of robberies, and 47% of aggravated assaults <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/clearance-browse-by/national-data">go uncleared every year</a>.</p>

        <p>One consistent finding in the social science literature is that if we really want to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/16/camden-nj-police-reboot-is-being-misused-debate-over-police-reform/">reduce crime</a>, <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf">education equity</a> and the <a href="http://users.cla.umn.edu/~uggen/Uggen_Shannon_SP_14.pdf">establishment of a work infrastructure</a> is the best approach. A study using <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/07/over-past-60-years-more-spending-police-hasnt-necessarily-meant-less-crime/">60 years of data</a> found that an increase in funding for police did not significantly relate to a decrease in crime.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/06/19/what-does-defund-the-police-mean-and-does-it-have-merit/">Responding to activism,</a> some large municipalities with a history of police brutality have reallocated funds in line with the defund police movement. For example, Los Angeles will have at least $100 million reallocated away from LAPD to programs for minority communities. Altogether, it is clear that municipalities across the U.S. are making changes in line with the defund police movement. So, while the word “reallocate” may be a more palatable, digestible word on the House floor or at a city council meeting, “defund” surely gets more attention on a protest sign. And more importantly, it seems to be having an impact.</p>
